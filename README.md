# 🔷 Method of Averaged Marginals (MAM)

**Exact Wasserstein Barycenter via Douglas–Rachford Splitting / Averaged Marginals**  
*Mimouni, Malisani, Zhu & de Oliveira — SIAM J. Math. Data Sci., 2024*

This repository contains a clean, modular implementation of the **Method of Averaged Marginals (MAM)** to compute **exact (unregularized)** Wasserstein barycenters of discrete probability distributions. It supports both **balanced** and **unbalanced** variants by formulating the problem as a **monotone inclusion** solved via **Douglas–Rachford splitting**.

MAM interprets each step as an **averaging of projected marginals**, which leads to highly parallelizable, scalable computations suitable for large datasets.

## 🚀 Highlights

- **Exact solution** of the linear (non-entropic) Wasserstein barycenter problem
- Supports both **balanced** and **unbalanced** (mass creation/destruction) OT
- Based on **Douglas–Rachford operator splitting**
- Each iteration involves simple, exact projections (e.g., simplex projections)
- Interpretable as an **averaged marginal projection method**
- Fully **parallelizable** (MPI), highly scalable
- State-of-the-art convergence properties (faster and more stable than Sinkhorn)

## ⚙️ Running MAM in Parallel

The MAM algorithm is implemented to run in **parallel using MPI**, enabling efficient computation on large datasets. It distributes the input distributions across multiple processes to parallelize marginal projections and speed up convergence.

To run MAM, use `mpiexec` (or `mpirun`) and specify the number of processes (typically the number of CPU cores you want to use):

```bash
mpiexec -n 4 python your_script.py
```

For example, to run the main MAM computation on a dataset with 4 parallel workers:

```bash
cd toy_example
mpiexec -n 4 python demo.py
```

> 🔁 You can change `-n 4` to any number of available cores on your machine or computing cluster.

> ⚠️ Make sure `mpi4py` is installed in your environment:
> ```bash
> pip install mpi4py
> ```

## 🚀 Comparison with state of the art methods

MAM has been compared to IBP, a widely adopted state-of-the-art method known for its simplicity and practical accuracy. However, as demonstrated in the article, when high-precision results are required, our proposed exact method offers significantly better performance and reliability.
